# RockPaperScissors
RockPaperScissors Project from Odin Project
## Objective
Learn how to combine HTML/CSS/JS to make a simple application, 
in this case Rock, Paper, Scissors.
## Process
After spending time in The Odin Project and creating my own homepage,
I continued to go through the lessons and learned about the DOM model.

Basically, I learned how to manipulate HTML/CSS through JS and saw how
it was used to change the page based off actions done by the user. 

No longer were the webpages going to be static, now I can make it do stuff at my will.

## Struggle
What is kind of tough was understanding the new syntax that was involved in DOM and making it work with the webpage. 

## Next steps
- Implement a scoring system.
- Add computer's choice as an image in a game.
- Update the random function upon which the computer runs off of.
